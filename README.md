## Map1: Roadmap inspired by female geography

**Feature**:  Corvallis is a college town. Some students have work or go to parties on the weekend. This map hightlights the primary roads in Corvallis. The idea is to highlight roads that will likely be illuminated at night and will have more traffic. These roads should be safer for women to travel on at night. The contrast of pink roads on a dark background is meant to appeal to the female target audience.

**Idea**:The idea behind this map is from female geography. I noticed that I received more sexual harassment alert emails from OSU in 2016 than the previous year. 

## Map2: Travel with green

**Feature**:  This is a basemap for road trips in Oregon. I use a tree pattern to highlight forested areas. Also, highways that cross with forests are highlighted to be more obvious than I-5. Water, such as lakes and rivers, are also easy to identify. I added an orange color to the background layer so the whole map looks warm and happy, which fits the theme of "travel". The map aims to be used when people want to create a roadtrip map for visiting forested areas. 

**Idea**: Many of my Chinese friends rarely drive to the forests in Oregon. I think that is also true for most international students. Thus, I want to create a map to show international students the forested area in Oregon and the scenic ways to get there.
